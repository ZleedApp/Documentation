# Where I've Been

There hasn't been any activity in the past 3 months, you're probably wondering why.

<!-- more -->

Well, I've been busy with school and a some IRL stuff happend. I have been planning some stuff behind the scenes a bit though, but I currently lack the motivation to continue on some of the planning or write code for the project. I plan on coming back to the project in a few weeks if time allows it, we'll see if I get motivation again.

There is also a few things that would be better done in a team but couldn't yet find anyone who would be interested in joining the project and contributing code, I invited [Myadeleines](https://github.com/Myadeleines) for doing the website design but that isn't a priority right now. There is also some limitations I'll not mention here for now.

My focus will be on getting a team thogether so even if I contribute some code don't expect much.
