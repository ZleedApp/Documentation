I have been planning some stuff behind the scenes a bit though, but I currently lack the motivation to continue on some of the planning or write code for the project. I plan on coming back to the project in a few weeks if time allows it, we'll see if I get motivation again.</p> <p>There is also a few things that would be better done in a team but couldn't yet find anyone who would be interested in joining the project and contributing code, I invited Myadeleines for doing the website design but that isn't a priority right now. There is also some limitations I'll not mention here for now.</p> <p>My focus will be on getting a team thogether so even if I contribute some code don't expect much.</p>"},{"location":"knowledge-base/","title":"Knowledge Base","text":""},{"location":"knowledge-base/faq/","title":"FAQ","text":""},{"location":"knowledge-base/streaming/","title":"Streaming","text":""},{"location":"knowledge-base/discord-bot/","title":"Discord Bot","text":"<ul> <li>Invite</li> <li>Source Code</li> </ul>"},{"location":"knowledge-base/discord-bot/#what-does-it-do","title":"What does it do?","text":"<p>It enables you to interact with Zleed from Discord.
